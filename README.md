#### Team Members: Mezbahuddin Prottoy, Michelle Tatara, Mehruj Kamal

#### Contributions: 
We all are responsible for overall project and  review each other work but we each will focus on specific view such as Admin View, Instructor View, and Student View.  

Mezbahuddin- Student View 

Michelle- Instructor View 

Mehruj- Admin View (handles the enrollment and approval for enrollment process which bridges between both views) 

#### Navigating our Website.
In navigating our websites there are three types of user that can access the website. They are Student,Teacher, and Admin. Student and teachers can sign up and login through the homepage of our signup and login page. Teacher has their own signup page that they can register through with the use of the Teacher button that directs them to Teacher registration form. Once registration is complete you can now sign in to Teacher or Student homepage depending on the type of user you are. You can not sign up as an Admin and is only given a set username of admin and password of user for the Admin account. Their role is to see the database of all registration and login activity of student and teachers at the moment. The choice of database management we have used for this project is mongoDB. 
#### Student View:
So you first land on the sign/in and sign up page. Currently, there are three buttons for the three different paths in our website. There are:StudentView,TeacherView,and AdminView. For student, when you click the button, it will land you on the student homepage. On the homepage, you have the option to view your current classes and enroll in a class. When you click on a current class, you can view the assignment for that class.When you click on the assignment, you can save the assignment or come back to it. When you enroll in the class, you can read the class description and see who is teaching the course. Later on, we will allow to search classes using the searchbar but right now we have a preloaded class on you can try enrolling in the StudentHomepage.
#### Teacher View:
For teacher, when you click the button, it will land you on the teacher homepage. You can see the courses you are currently teaching, there is the option to create a new course, view any submitted assignments, and view any pending applications from students. When you click on a certain course you are teaching, you have the option to create a new assignment for the course. When you click on creating a new course, you input the information about the course into a form. When you click on a certain assignment to grade, you can view the assignment submitted by students and submit the final grade. For the pending applications from students, it shows the list of students that are trying to enroll and for which class. 
#### Admin View:
For admin, there is no signup page for it. There is only a set user: admin, password: user. after entering in the user and password field correctly there will be a textbox that says "login successfuly" as shown below:

Admin view is limited because much of it requires receiving data from the database. Admins are able to see list of available classes, teachers, and students. They are also able to see past search history. For past search history, we created a page with sample data. Wherever in the pages says, "hyperlink!!!", it means when we have actual data to connect to, we will link it to there with a hyperlink. 
When you click on the logo, it directs you back to the respective homepage of the respective user. Also admin can see the database portion of all user login activity at the moment shown below:

#### The following is a revised,digital version of our sitemap which we will be basing all future versions of our code off of

#### The following 4 pictures are michelle's work. 
#### The first picture is Michelle's Site Map concept.

#### The next three pictures compose a handwritten version of Michelle's wireframe. 
The three pictures are divided by the different query possibilites for three different types of users. The first picture is a mockup for user type: teacher.

The second picture is a mockup for user type:student.

My contributions to this readme are the first four pictures which portray a possible mockup of the chalkboard site. What I learned from this assignment is how to style a readme. I learned how to use markdown language and how to upload images to the github readme using instances. I also learned how to use a digital tool to create sitemaps and I have begun to understand how websites should flow together. Lastly, I also learned about wireframing. 
This concluded Michelle's portion. If any picture is unclear, please let Michelle know.

#### The following 4 pictures are Mez's work
#### The first picture is Mez's Site Map concept.

The first picture is a mockup for user type: Student.

My contributions to this readme are also the first four pictures which portray a possible design of our chalkboard site. I learned many things from this assignment. I learned how to style a readme and how to host images on GitHub. I used the website Lucidchart to design my sitemap and learned more about wireframing. Ultimately, I was able to learn more how websites are put together and the planning that goes into it. 
This concludes Mez's portion
